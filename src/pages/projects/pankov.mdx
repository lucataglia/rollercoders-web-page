# Pankov
Pankov is a dice game developed with [Akka][1] and [Firebase][2]. We use to play that game
at the university during our breaks, when during the Spring of 2020 I had the idea of 
study Akka, Pankov was the perfect use case because is a multiplayer online game and
that's feet very well to the actor paradigm that Akka expose. 

Pankov can be played both from desktop and mobile devices. If you are playing from
desktop you have to connect to the port `:2121` while if you are playing from mobile
(using [Termux][3]) you can connect to the port `:6565` in order to have access to the
mobile layout of the game. If you will find the mobile layout more confortable you could
defenitly use it also when you play from desktop.

```bash
openssl s_client -connect pankov.rollercoders.net:2121 # For desktop devices

openssl s_client -connect pankov.rollercoders.net:6565 # For mobile devices
```
